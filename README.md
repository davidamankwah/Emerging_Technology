## The exploration of Deutsch's algorithm

This repository contains an exploration of Deutsch's algorithm, a quantum algorithm that displays the power of quantum computing. One of the two notebooks in the repository examines the capabilities and applications of the Deutsch algorithm. The primary topic of discussion in the project notebook is the Deatuch Algorithm.

## Notebooks
project.ipynb: In this notebook, the Deutsch algorithm is examined. This is the location where the algorithm research will be documented. 

tasks.ipynb: There are four tasks with various topics to research and work on in this notebook.

## Prerequisites
Prior to proceeding, install the necessary prerequisites on your system.

1. Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/download)
2. Jupyter Notebook (https://jupyter.org/)
3. Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
4. Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)
5. Qiskit (https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit)

## How to Run

put better code format for code commands
# Install Visual Studio Code
1. Visit Visual Studio Code's website and select a installer for your operating system to download.

2. When download is done, download the installer and follow the steps to complete installation.

3. When installtion is done, search for Visual Studio Code in your start menu to open.

4. Check if installation is done correctly. Open your command prompt and type code --version


# Install Python
1. Visit Python's website and select a installer for your operating system to download.

2. When download is done, download the installer and follow the steps to complete installation. Make sure to add Python to your system's PATH environment variable.

3. Check the installation by opening a command prompt and typing  python --version.

4. Make sure to install pip. Open your command prompt and type python -m pip install --upgrade pip.

# Download Anaconda
1. Visit Anaconda's website and select a installer for your operating system and Python version.

2. Download the installer and run it.

3. Follow the steps to finish installing.

4. Check the installation by opening a command prompt and typing conda --version.


# Install Jupyter Notebook
Make sure to install Anaconda for this section.

1. Open a command prompt, and use the following command:

 pip install jupyter

 this will Jupyter Notebook and its dependencies.

2. When installation is finished, open a command prompt, and use the following command:

jupyter notebook

This will start the Juptyer Notebook and open up a web browser.



# Install qiskit
Make sure qiskit is installed for quantumn computing framework. This will be needed for the implementation of the quantum circuit in Python: 

1. Open a terminal or command prompt, and use this command:

```bash
pip install qiskit


## Clone the Repository
Open a terminal window, and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

Here is the following command: 

git clone https://github.com/davidamankwah/emerging_technology.git
cd emerging_technology
