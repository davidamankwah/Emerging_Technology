## The exploration of Deutsch's algorithm

This repository contains an exploration of Deutsch's algorithm, a quantum algorithm that displays the power of quantum computing. One of the two notebooks in the repository examines the capabilities and applications of the Deutsch algorithm. The primary topic of discussion in the project notebook is the Deatuch Algorithm.

## Notebooks
project.ipynb: In this notebook, the Deutsch algorithm is examined. This is the location where the algorithm research will be documented. 

tasks.ipynb: There are four tasks with various topics to research and work on in this notebook.
